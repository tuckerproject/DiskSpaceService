# DiskSpaceService

A lightweight, self‑hosted Windows Service for monitoring disk space, logging metrics to SQL, and sending real‑time alerts through GroupMe or SMTP. Built on .NET 8.0 and designed for reliability, clarity, and minimal configuration.

🧭 Overview
DiskSpaceService continuously monitors one or more drives and provides:
• 	Real‑time alerts when disk space falls below a configurable threshold
• 	Recovery notifications when space returns to normal
• 	Daily SQL logging of disk metrics
• 	Rolling log files for auditability
• 	A clean, state‑driven architecture that avoids duplicate alerts
• 	Support for GroupMe and SMTP alerting
• 	A simple XML configuration file
This service is ideal for home labs, small servers, or any environment where lightweight, dependable monitoring is needed.

🚀 Features
✔ Continuous Alert Monitoring
Runs every minute and uses a state machine to detect:
• 	ALERT — Drive below threshold
• 	NORMAL — Drive healthy
• 	NOT_READY — Drive unavailable or unmounted
Alerts are only sent when the state changes.
✔ Machine‑Name‑Prefixed Alerts
All alerts include the machine name, making multi‑machine monitoring easy.
✔ Network‑Ready Alerting
Alerts are delayed until DNS resolution succeeds, preventing startup failures.
✔ State File Persistence
Alert state is stored in:
C:\ProgramData\DiskSpaceService\alert_state.json
This prevents reboot spam and ensures correct behavior across restarts.
✔ Daily SQL Reporting
Once per day, the service logs:
• 	Total space
• 	Used space
• 	Free space
• 	Percent free
• 	Drive letter
• 	Machine name
• 	Timestamp
Missed runs (e.g., due to reboot) are automatically recovered.
✔ Rolling Log Files
Logs are stored in:
C:\ProgramData\DiskSpaceService\Logs
• 	Rotates at 1 MB
• 	Keeps the last 3 logs
• 	Ensures clean audit history
✔ GroupMe & SMTP Alerts
Choose one or both:
• 	GroupMe bot messages
• 	SMTP email alerts
